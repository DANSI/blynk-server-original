# This is not the original Blynk-server source.
This is a copy from https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server.

Blynk server repository was offline some time ago. Then the log4j vul was found.
After doom369 has fixed the repo, i have cloned it because i have the server running locally for my house, so i have a dependence of it.
This clone is in a lower healthy as the original source.
So the original source would be the best for you.

I have forked the blynk-blynk server to https://github.com/DANSI/blynk-server, because i realize, 
that the forked one is not deleted or removed automaticly by github, when the original repo is deleted/removed.

Please remove your dependencies to this repo and change to the original [source](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server) , or my [forked](https://github.com/DANSI/blynk-server) one, if you want.

I plan to remove this repo in the future forked one.
